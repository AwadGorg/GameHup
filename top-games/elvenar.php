                          In InnoGames’ Elvenar, you can build an epic fantasy city,
                           populated by elves or humans, and watch it grow into a sprawling metropolis,
                           awash in riches and brimming with military might. <br>
                           The elves have powerful magic at their disposal,
                          while humans are well-versed in the arts of war.<br><br>
                          There are many ways to improve your city. Research technologies and gather
                           resources to improve your buildings and customize
                           their appearance or embark on quests to acquire fantastic
                            relics that will further boost your city’s production. There’s a huge
                          world to explore and fantastic creatures to tame — or to take into battle against your enemies!

                      Each faction has access to 5 different units that are unlocked at various stages throughout the tech tree, whilst the factions have different units many of them follow similar base roles such as the Human Axe Barbarian and the Elven Sword Dancer being the primary melee troop, whereas the Elven Sorceress uses powerful ranged magic to reduce enemy damage the Human Priest focuses on using his divine abilities to lower an enemy’s defences.
<br><br>
                      Each unit as well as having its own style of combat and attacks will also have its own movement range when manoeuvring around the hex based combat maps, units can be moved and positioned to block access to their weaker units, take cover behind terrain features and use all manner of strategy to outflank and outsmart their opponent. Currently the game does not feature a PVP element and instead focuses primarily on combat against AI opponents.
